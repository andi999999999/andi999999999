### Hi! I'm Andreas, 
I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Vienna. While doing a semester abroad at the Australian National University (ANU), I discovered a passion for low-level systems and hardware-centric design.

Here are two of my recent projects:

* **[Dual-FPGA Keyboard Input System](https://github.com/andi999999999/Dual-FPGA-Keyboard-Input-System)**

*A from-scratch Verilog system featuring a custom synchronous protocol and PS/2 decoder. Selected as exemplar project by professor.*

* **[Real-Time STM32 Sensor Analysis](https://github.com/andi999999999/STM32-Sensor-Data-Acquisition-System)**

*An interrupt-driven C application featuring a custom peak-detection algorithm and system optimization.*
